       <p class="info">Alan Mathison Turing (June 23, 1912 – June 7, 1954) was a British mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is widely considered the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.  Despite these achievements he was never fully recognized in his home country during his lifetime for being a homosexual and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.<p/>

      <h2>Timeline</h2><br>
      <ul>
        <li>1931 a 1934 - Turing studied at King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class honors in mathematics.</li><br>
        <li>1936 - Turing published his article "On computable numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem". It was published in the journal Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society in two parts, the first on 30 November and the second on 23 December.</li><br>
        <li>1938 - Turing earned his PhD at the Department of Mathematics at Princeton; his dissertation, Ordinal-Based Logic Systems.</li><br>
        <li>1938 - Turing worked part-time at the Government Code and Cipher School (GC&CS), the British code-breaking organization. He focused on the cryptographic analysis of the Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany, along with Dilly Knox, a senior cryptanalyst at GC&CS.</li><br>
        <li>1936 - Turing developed a machine capable of deciphering the “Enigma”, code used by the Nazis, during World War II, thus giving the Allies an advantage that allowed them to defeat Germany more quickly.</li><br>
        <li>1952 - Alan Turing faced a criminal case, because at the time, in England, homosexuality was considered a crime. He was stripped of his post at Bletchley Park, the English decoding center, condemned and chemically castrated (with injections of female hormones).</li><br>
